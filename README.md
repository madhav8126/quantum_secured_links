# quantum_secured_links
This project is a Python-based simulation of a quantum-secure communication link. It demonstrates a hybrid security model that combines the unconditional security of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for key generation with the speed and efficiency of classical symmetric-key encryption (AES-256) for data transmission.
